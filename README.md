DeepStream is a SDK which enable us to create video analazing system. And LPR is a License Plate Recognition.Nvidia has published LPR system which run on DeepStream. But the main code of that is writtern with C lang. I rewrite LPR DeepStream code with Python. It is easy to read and use for Pythonista.
