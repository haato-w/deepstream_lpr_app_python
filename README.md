# deepstream_lpr_app_python

DeepStream is a SDK which enable us to create video analazing system[https://developer.nvidia.com/deepstream-sdk]. And LPR is a License Plate Recognition. Nvidia has published LPR system which run on DeepStream[https://github.com/NVIDIA-AI-IOT/deepstream_lpr_app]. But the main code of that is writtern with C lang. I rewrite LPR DeepStream code with Python. It is easy to read and use for Pythonista. Some features may be missing compared to the official LPR DeepStream code. Please clone and rewrite to add any function which you want.
